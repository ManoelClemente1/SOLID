# Project to study SOLID principles and Design Patterns with Java

### OO
* Cohesion:
A cohesive class does one thing well
Cohesive classes should not have multiple responsibilities
* Encapsulation:
Getters and setters are not efficient ways to apply encapsulation
It is interesting to only provide access to what is necessary in our classes
Encapsulation makes using our classes more easy and intuitive
* Coupling:
Coupling is the dependency between classes
Coupling is not always bad, and it is impossible to create a system without any coupling
We should control the level of coupling in our application

## SOLID
### Single Responsability Principle

* There should never be more than one reason for a class to change

### Open Closed Principle
* a class should be designed in such a way that it can be extended to add new functionality without modifying the existing code.
